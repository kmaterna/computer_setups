# April 13, 2020 and May 27, 2021
# Today I removed my python installation on my Mac and started all over. 

# Steps:
# Delete Miniconda3 directory, leaving the Mac python2.7 as the only one left. 
# Download miniconda3 installation script from the Miniconda webite and run it


In base environment: 
conda install nb_conda_kernels   # if you want to run Jupyter notebooks from different conda envs in the future
pip install jupyter
brew install --cask jupyter-notebook-viewer
brew install --cask --no-quarantine syntax-highlight


# My Environments: (conda env list)
# -base (not really used for anything)
# -research (basic stuff)
# -pygmt
# -isceenv
# -Strain_2D
# -mintpy


# Build a "research" environment: The basics and some research goodies using conda/pip
conda env create -f research_requirements.yaml 
OUTSIDE Requirements.yaml: 
pip install okada_wrapper   # for fault modeling
# Geodesy specific installations for "research" environment:
# From ~/Documents/Software/ directory: 
# kite native installation and slippy branch installation: 
cd ~/Documents/Software
git clone https://github.com/pyqtgraph/pyqtgraph.git
cd pyqtgraph; python setup.py install; cd ../
git clone https://github.com/pyrocko/kite.git
cd kite; python setup.py install; cd ../
cd slippy_gmt/SlipPy; python setup.py install; cd ../
In CGM directory: python setup.py install 


# pygmt Conda Environment: 
conda create env -f pygmt_requirements.yaml
conda activate pygmt
In slippy: python setup.py install
In cgm_readers: python setup.py install
In Elastic_stresses_py: pip install . 
In gnss_timeseries_viewers: pip install .

# Upgrade shortcuts: 
# conda install pygmt=0.5.0   # (done april 2022)
# conda update gmt
# conda upgrade -n base conda   # please do occasionally
# pip install --upgrade matplotlib  # nov 2023
conda install -c conda-forge asf_search


# ISCE conda environment:
conda env create -f isce_requirements.yaml
conda activate isceenv
# then manually run kite setup.py install and pyqtgraph setup.py install
conda install conda-forge::isce2   # ISN'T WORKING YET
# Note: I was never able to update ISCE2 through package managers. on a different linux system, I blew up the environment and re-installed it


# MINTPY CONDA ENVIRONMENT: Dev version instead of conda version, which has some issues
In Documents/Software: git clone https://github.com/insarlab/MintPy.git
conda env create --name mintpy -f ~/Documents/Software/MintPy/docs/environment.yml
conda activate mintpy
In ~/Software/MintPy: python setup.py install    # local install, for the bleeding edge version
pip install netCDF


# Strain_2D conda environment:
# go to Strain_2D directory: 
conda env create -f requirements.yml
pip install . 
pip install Tectonic-Utils
pip install shapely
pip install corner
pip install arviz


# elastic_py environment:
# Go to Elastic_Stresses_py directory:
conda env create -f requirements.yml
pip install . 
pip install okada_wrapper
